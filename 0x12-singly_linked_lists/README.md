# 0x12-singly_linked_lists Project

This directory contains my solutions for the "0x12-singly_linked_lists" project as part of the ALX low-level programming assignments. The project focuses on understanding and implementing singly linked lists in the C programming language.

## Files

This directory includes the following C files:

- `0-print_list.c`: A C program that prints all the elements of a `list_t` list.
- `1-list_len.c`: A C program that returns the number of elements in a linked `list_t` list.
- `2-add_node.c`: A C program that adds a new node at the beginning of a `list_t` list.
- `3-add_node_end.c`: A C program that adds a new node at the end of a `list_t` list.
- `4-free_list.c`: A C program that frees a `list_t` list.

## Getting Started

To test these programs, compile the C files using your preferred C compiler. For example, using GCC:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o singly_linked_lists


Then run the executable file to observe the implementation and manipulation of singly linked lists.
