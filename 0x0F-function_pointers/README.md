# 0x0F-function_pointers Project

This directory contains my solutions for the "0x0F-function_pointers" project as part of the ALX low-level programming assignments. The project focuses on understanding and utilizing function pointers in the C programming language.

## Files

This directory includes the following C files:

- `function_pointers.h`: A header file that contains function prototypes for the functions used in the project.
- `0-print_name.c`: A C program that prints a name using a function pointer.
- `1-array_iterator.c`: A C program that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
- `2-int_index.c`: A C program that searches for an integer.
- `3-calc.h`, `3-op_functions.c`, `3-get_op_func.c`: A program that performs simple operations.

## Getting Started

To test these programs, compile the C files using your preferred C compiler. For example, using GCC:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o function_pointers


Then run the executable file to observe the use of function pointers in various scenarios.
