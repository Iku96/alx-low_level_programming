# 0x0E-structures_typedef Project

This directory contains my solutions for the "0x0E-structures_typedef" project as part of the ALX low-level programming assignments. The project focuses on understanding and utilizing structures and typedef in the C programming language.

## Files

This directory includes the following C files:

- `dog.h`: A header file that defines a new type struct dog with the following elements.
- `1-init_dog.c`: A C program that initializes a variable of type struct dog.
- `2-print_dog.c`: A C program that prints a struct dog.
- `4-new_dog.c`: A C program that creates a new dog.

## Getting Started

To test these programs, compile the C files using your preferred C compiler. For example, using GCC:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o structures_typedef

Then run the executable file to observe the utilization of structures and typedef.
