# 0x15-file_io Assignment

This directory contains my solutions for the "0x15-file_io" assignment as part of the ALX low-level programming projects. The assignment focuses on file input/output operations in the C programming language.

## Files

This directory includes the following C files:

- `0-read_textfile.c`: A C program that reads a text file and prints it to the standard output.
- `1-create_file.c`: A C program that creates a file and writes text content to it.
- `2-append_text_to_file.c`: A C program that appends text at the end of a file.
- `3-cp.c`: A C program that copies the content of one file to another file.

## Getting Started

To test these programs, compile the C files using your preferred C compiler. For example, using GCC:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o file_io


Then run the executable file to observe the file input/output operations.
