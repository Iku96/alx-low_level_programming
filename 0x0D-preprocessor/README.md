# 0x0D-preprocessor Project

This directory contains my solutions for the "0x0D-preprocessor" project as part of the ALX low-level programming assignments. The project focuses on understanding and utilizing the C preprocessor.

## Files

This directory includes the following C files:

- `0-object_like_macro.h`: A header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.
- `1-pi.h`: A header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.
- `2-main.c`: A C program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from.
- `3-function_like_macro.h`: A function-like macro that computes the absolute value of a number.
- `4-sum.h`: A function-like macro that computes the sum of two numbers.

## Getting Started

To test these programs, compile the C files using your preferred C compiler. For example, using GCC:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o preprocessor


Then run the executable file to observe the behavior of the preprocessor directives.
