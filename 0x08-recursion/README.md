# 0x08-recursion Assignment

This directory contains my solutions for the "0x08-recursion" assignment as part of the ALX low-level programming projects. The assignment focuses on implementing recursion in C programming.

## Files

This directory includes the following files:

- `0-puts_recursion.c`: A C program that prints a string, followed by a new line, using recursion.
- `1-print_rev_recursion.c`: A C program that prints a string in reverse, using recursion.
- `2-strlen_recursion.c`: A C program that returns the length of a string using recursion.
- `3-factorial.c`: A C program that returns the factorial of a given number using recursion.
- `4-pow_recursion.c`: A C program that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y` using recursion.

## Getting Started

To test these programs, compile the C files using your preferred C compiler. For example, using GCC:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o recursion


Then run the executable file to observe the output.
