# 0x0A-argc_argv Project

This directory contains my solutions for the "0x0A-argc_argv" project as part of the ALX low-level programming assignments. The project focuses on using command-line arguments in C programming.

## Files

This directory includes the following C files:

- `0-whatsmyname.c`: A C program that prints the name of the program.
- `1-args.c`: A C program that prints all arguments it receives.
- `2-args.c`: A C program that prints the number of arguments passed to it.
- `3-mul.c`: A C program that multiplies two numbers passed as arguments.

## Getting Started

To test these programs, compile the C files using your preferred C compiler. For example, using GCC:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o argc_argv

Then run the executable file with different arguments to observe the behavior.
