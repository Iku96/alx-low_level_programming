# 0x09-static_libraries Assignment

This directory contains my solutions for the "0x09-static_libraries" assignment as part of the ALX low-level programming projects. The assignment focuses on creating and utilizing static libraries in the C programming language.

## Getting Started

To utilize the static library, you can create a simple C program and link it with the library during the compilation process. For example, using GCC:

gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -L. -lholberton -o executable_file source_file.c

Make sure to include the necessary header files in your C program.
