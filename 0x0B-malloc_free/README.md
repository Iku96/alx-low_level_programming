# 0x0B-malloc_free Project

This directory contains my solutions for the "0x0B-malloc_free" project as part of the ALX low-level programming assignments. The project focuses on dynamic memory allocation and memory management in the C programming language.

## Files

This directory includes the following C files:

- `0-create_array.c`: A C program that creates an array of characters.
- `1-strdup.c`: A C program that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, containing a copy of the string.
- `2-str_concat.c`: A C program that concatenates two strings.
- `3-alloc_grid.c`: A C program that returns a pointer to a 2-dimensional array of integers.
- `4-free_grid.c`: A C program that frees a 2-dimensional grid previously created.

## Getting Started

To test these programs, compile the C files using your preferred C compiler. For example, using GCC:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o malloc_free

Then run the executable file to observe the dynamic memory allocation and freeing.
