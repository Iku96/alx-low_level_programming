# 0x10-variadic_functions Project

This directory contains my solutions for the "0x10-variadic_functions" project as part of the ALX low-level programming assignments. The project focuses on understanding and utilizing variadic functions in the C programming language.

## Files

This directory includes the following C files:

- `variadic_functions.h`: A header file that contains function prototypes for the variadic functions used in the project.
- `0-sum_them_all.c`: A C program that returns the sum of all its parameters.
- `1-print_numbers.c`: A C program that prints numbers, followed by a new line.
- `2-print_strings.c`: A C program that prints strings, followed by a new line.
- `3-print_all.c`: A C program that prints anything.

## Getting Started

To test these programs, compile the C files using your preferred C compiler. For example, using GCC:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o variadic_functions


Then run the executable file to observe the utilization of variadic functions in different scenarios.
