This directory contains my solutions for the "0x14-bit_manipulation" assignment as part of the ALX low-level programming projects. The assignment focuses on how to perform bit manipulation in C programming.

## Files

This directory includes the following files:

* [0-binary_to_uint.c](./0-binary_to_uint.c): A function that converts a binary number to an unsigned integer.
* [1-print_binary.c](./1-print_binary.c): A function that prints the binary representation of a number.
* [2-get_bit.c](./2-get_bit.c): A function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
* [3-set_bit.c](./3-set_bit.c): A function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
* [4-clear_bit.c](./4-clear_bit.c): A function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
* [5-flip_bits.c](./5-flip_bits.c): A function that returns the number of bits needed to flip to get from one number to another.


## Getting Started

To test these programs, compile the C files using your preferred C compiler. For example, using GCC:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o <output file>


Then run the executable file to observe the output.
