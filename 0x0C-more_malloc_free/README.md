# 0x0C-more_malloc_free Project

This directory contains my solutions for the "0x0C-more_malloc_free" project as part of the ALX low-level programming assignments. The project focuses on further understanding and implementing dynamic memory allocation using malloc and free in the C programming language.

## Files

This directory includes the following C files:

- `0-malloc_checked.c`: A C program that allocates memory using malloc.
- `1-string_nconcat.c`: A C program that concatenates two strings.
- `2-calloc.c`: A C program that allocates memory for an array using calloc.
- `3-array_range.c`: A C program that creates an array of integers.
- `100-realloc.c`: A C program that reallocates a memory block using realloc.

## Getting Started

To test these programs, compile the C files using your preferred C compiler. For example, using GCC:

gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o more_malloc_free


Then run the executable file to observe the dynamic memory allocation and deallocation in various scenarios.
